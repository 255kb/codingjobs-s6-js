/**
 * Home exercise:
 * 
 * - create a list of users (objects)
 * - user objects need to have some flags (booleans): 'connected', 'numberOfComments' 
 * - display the list of users in an HTML element with the number of comments
 * - add a red/green circle (new element?) next to each user, depending on the 'connected' flag (boolean)
 * - sort the list by the number of comments
 * 
 * 
 * Bonus:
 * - add a new property 'comments' to each user object, and display in the page, for each user, a list of its own posts (title is enough)
 *
